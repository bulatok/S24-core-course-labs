# Continuous Integration Best Practices for Go

## Workflow Overview
This CI workflow is designed to automate building, testing, linting, security vulnerability checking, and Docker image deployment for Go applications.

## Building
The workflow starts with the building phase, where Go modules are cached for faster builds. We utilize GitHub Actions to install Go dependencies and set up the Go environment before building the application.

## Linting
Next, we perform linting using the golangci-lint tool to detect code-style violations and potential errors in the Go codebase. This step ensures code quality and adherence to best practices.

## Testing
Unit tests are executed using the `go test` command to validate code functionality correctness. Testing is crucial for identifying and fixing bugs early in the development process.

## Security Checks
Security vulnerabilities in the Go codebase are scanned using Snyk. By integrating vulnerability scanning into our CI workflow, we proactively identify and mitigate security risks.

## Docker Deployment
Upon successful completion of the previous steps, the Docker image is built and pushed to Docker Hub. Docker integration streamlines deployment and ensures consistency across different environments.
