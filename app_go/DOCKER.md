# Docker Best Practices for Go Application

In this Dockerfile, several best practices have been implemented to enhance security and efficiency:

1. **Use Multistage Build**: A multistage Docker build is utilized to separate the build environment from the final production image. This helps reduce the final image size and ensures only necessary artifacts are included.

2. **Use Lightweight Base Image**: The final production image is based on `alpine:3.14`, providing a minimal and efficient base for the container.

3. **Non-Root User**: The Dockerfile creates a non-root user (`myuser`) within the container to run the application, improving security by reducing the potential impact of security vulnerabilities.

4. **Minimize Layers**: Commands are combined where possible to minimize the number of layers in the image, reducing its size and complexity.

5. **Copy Only Necessary Files**: Only the necessary files are copied into the container, reducing the risk of including unnecessary or sensitive information.

6. **Clear Cache**: The `go mod download` command is run separately to download dependencies, allowing Docker to cache the dependencies layer separately from the code layer.

These practices collectively contribute to a more secure, efficient, and maintainable Docker image for the Go application.
