# Continuous Integration Best Practices

## Workflow Structure
- Organized workflow with distinct jobs for building, security checks, and Docker integration.
- Utilized the `needs` keyword to create a dependency chain between jobs.

## Dependencies
- Cached Python dependencies to enhance workflow efficiency using the `actions/cache` action.
- Employed a specific cache key based on the contents of the `requirements.txt` file.

## Linter and Tests
- Integrated Flake8 for code linting and pytest for running tests.
- Ensured the workflow fails on linting or test failures, promoting code quality.

## Security Checks
- Implemented Snyk for checking vulnerabilities in the Python code.
- Utilized GitHub Secrets to securely pass the Snyk token for authentication.

## Docker Integration
- Incorporated Docker-related steps for building and pushing images.
- Applied Docker login action with secure handling of DockerHub credentials using GitHub Secrets.

## Badges
- Added a workflow status badge to provide visibility into the CI workflow's status.

## Build Cache
- Leveraged build caching for Python dependencies, improving workflow speed.
